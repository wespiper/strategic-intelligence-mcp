## Data Models

### Strategic Conversation
```typescript
interface StrategyConversation {
  id: string;
  type: 'market-analysis' | 'product-roadmap' | 'competitive-strategy' | 'monetization' | 'go-to-market' | 'technical-milestone-review' | 'business-goal-assessment';
  title: string;
  timestamp: string;
  participants: string[];
  context: {
    technicalMilestone?: string;
    businessTrigger?: string;
    marketEvent?: string;
    urgency?: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  };
  insights: StrategyInsight[];
  decisions: StrategyDecision[];
  actionItems: ActionItem[];
  conversationSummary: string;
  keyQuestions: string[];
  status: 'draft' | 'active' | 'completed' | 'archived';
}
```

### Business Goal
```typescript
interface BusinessGoal {
  id: string;
  category: 'revenue' | 'product' | 'market' | 'technical' | 'operational';
  title: string;
  description: string;
  metrics: GoalMetric[];
  milestones: Milestone[];

## Project Integration

This MCP server is designed to integrate with any software development workflow:

- **Insights Integration**: Can connect to `.claude/insights/accumulated-learnings.md` or similar files for technical pattern extraction
- **Reflection Integration**: Links to development milestone documentation and retrospectives
- **Strategic Alignment**: Maps technical features to business value and competitive advantages
- **Progress Tracking**: Correlates development milestones with strategic goal advancement

## Storage

Currently uses JSON file storage (`strategic-data.json`) with a PostgreSQL-ready schema design. The storage adapter pattern enables easy migration to PostgreSQL when scaling requirements demand it.

Storage includes:
- Strategic conversations with full context and outcomes
- Business goals with metrics and progress tracking
- Strategic insights with impact categorization
- Development-business alignment mappings
- Complete audit trail and metadata

## Future Enhancements

- **PostgreSQL Migration**: Scale to relational database for advanced analytics
- **Integration Tools**: Connect to existing project insights and reflection workflows
- **Advanced Analytics**: Pattern recognition and predictive strategic intelligence
- **Collaboration Features**: Multi-stakeholder conversation management
- **Reporting Tools**: Generate strategic reports for stakeholders
