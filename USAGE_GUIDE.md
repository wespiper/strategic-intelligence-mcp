# Strategic Intelligence MCP Server - Usage Guide

This is a standalone MCP server that provides strategic intelligence capabilities for any software project.

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

### 2. Claude Desktop Configuration

Add to your Claude Desktop `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "strategic-intelligence": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["./dist/index.js"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/strategic-intelligence-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/strategic-intelligence-mcp` with the actual path to this directory.

### 3. Initialize Your Project

**IMPORTANT**: Start by initializing the strategic intelligence system with your project context. This makes all subsequent tools much more effective.

#### Option A: Quick Setup Wizard
```javascript
quick_setup_wizard({"wizardStep": "start"})
```

#### Option B: Manual Initialization
```javascript
initialize_project_context({
  "projectName": "Your Project Name",
  "projectDescription": "Brief description of your project",
  "industry": "saas", // or fintech, ecommerce, gaming, etc.
  "businessModel": "b2b", // or b2c, subscription, enterprise, etc.
  "stage": "growth", // or mvp, early-stage, scaling, etc.
  "keyMetrics": ["Monthly Recurring Revenue", "Customer Acquisition Cost"],
  "strategicPriorities": ["Improve API performance", "Launch mobile app", "Expand to enterprise"]
})
```

#### Option C: Import from Existing Documents
```javascript
import_context_from_document({
  "documentContent": "... paste your README, business plan, or strategy doc here ...",
  "documentType": "readme", // or business-plan, strategy-doc, etc.
  "extractionFocus": ["business-goals", "technical-milestones"],
  "createInitialGoals": true,
  "createInitialMilestones": true
})
```
